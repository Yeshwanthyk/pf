Hello friends,

After reading Make Time, which is book about building a more robust workflow, I have been slowly adopting many of the tactics in the book. Two of the most successful tactics in making my day really productive have been - waking up early at around 5:30 AM and removing what the book calls “infinity pools” . Like many of us for years I have struggled with being sucked into one “infinity pool” or another, be it Twitter, Reddit or Instagram. But, those days are no more. I completely deleted all apps from my phone and hid my browser from the main page. This might come across as an extreme step but I have come to learn that this is the only way to trick myself to build healthy habits. With everything out of the way, I can only do the things that actually add value to me in the long run.

P. on a cold sunday afternoon

We watched Chaitanya Tamhane’s 2014 debut movie Court a few weeks back. Chaitanya’s approach to this movie was to allow the camera to capture what was happening in front of it. We basically start with a social activist folk singer who gets arrested for “pushing” a sewage worker to commit suicide after one of his performance. We then follow all the characters through the motions of the court and their lives.

The defence attorney, a wealthy lawyer who family owns quiet a lot of property in Mumbai, fights for the release of the folk singer (and many like him who get unfairly trapped in the system). The prosecutor is a working mother who raises two kids, makes food for the entire family and squeezes time in the night to work on her cases. The judge is believer in numerology but is considered a very logical and efficient man in the court system.

The most chilling parts of the movie are the court proceedings. In the decades we watched Indian movies (or even Hollywood movies for that matter), you might be thinking that the scenes might have been engrossing because of some spectacular cross-examinations and monologues. We are treated to none of that. The court scenes are very cold, where most times there is no real progress made on the case and everything is pushed to another date a few months later.

I think India can be proud that they choose this movie as the country’s Oscar pick. In sharp contrast to 2019 where they picked Gully Boy.

Also, if the cold documentary nature of Court appeals to you, I would really suggest director Kazuhiro Soda’s Campaign which gives us an unique insight into the bizarre world of Japanese elections .

It feels so surreal to realize that Trump lost. Like everyone else, I had CNN on all the time. That week I didn’t fare well with “infinity pools”. At the end of it, I was reminded of this wonderful shorts made by the amazing animator Bill Plympton - Trump Bites

Bill Plympton works in the medium of hand drawn animations which creates these wonderful and warm works of art. This is a video of him explaining his process,

Oh, we have a Simpson’s version too!

I have off late been really obsessed with the world of Explorables. Explorables are basically a more tactile way to help both teach or learn really complex topics. One of the nicest examples of this I have seen is this website by programmer Josh Comeau.

We work our way through how waveforms work but he throws in a lot of interactive examples (hence, the term explorables) to further understand all the topics he covers. This is the field of programming that is the most exciting for me. Particularly, when thinking of better and more effective ways of building strong mental models.

That’s all for this issue. Thank you for allowing me into your inboxes.
