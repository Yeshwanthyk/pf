I hate non-fiction books. I always hated them. Fiction was always my safe harbor. I could escape into the stories and allow the words to form a warm blanket around me. The few non-fiction books I read in the past never stayed with me—too much fluff, authors who would walk around in circles without saying much, and where is my warm word rug.

I was wrong.

### Why books don't work

Andy matuschak, a computer scientist and explorer of tools for thought, [wrote about](https://andymatuschak.org/books/) how books are limited by their medium. We end up making large time investment with serious non-fiction and we get short-changed in the end. It is not the fault of books, it is frailty in-built in human cognition.

Books are built upon the model of transmitting knowledge from the author to the reader. To understand these ideas and themes, we might have to read a book a couple of times. I can imagine many of us having this experience with a book, where we read it and felt like we had a grasp of all the themes explored within. A few weeks later, we remember a couple of salient themes with vague confidence. A few months later, we remember even less.

Andy moves into his area of interest from this springboard and starts discussing how we can make the form works for us instead—with spaced repetition and building a web of thought.

In my hunt to allow myself to follow my curiosities, first I had to break my own Secret Rules.

### Secret Rules

You know the Secret Rules you've set for yourself. You will finish a book that you start. You will finish the TV series, even though it gives you no joy. How can this being something useful if you are having fun!?

In [[finish - give yourself the gift of done]], Jon Acuff talk about all these rules we set up for ourselves that don't stand up when scrutinized. Like layers of dust that accumulates in the corners of rooms, we follow them without any thought.

The first thing I did was to throw away these Secret Rules and allow myself to have fun. Allow myself to be childlike in following my interests.

### Open Mind

Like finding a pearl in an oyster, I realized I have to get over the 1-inch-barriers I had with non fiction books. It took me years to understand what kind of fiction I enjoyed. I had to do the same with other forms of writing.

I started being emphatic with the author, accepting them for being who they are, looking for the pearls. Friend who talks too loud, but has your best interest at heart. In some books I found further resources, that turned out to be more interesting that the book I was currently reading. In a few other, once I understood who they are, the fog cleared and I could see what they were trying to explore.

### Audiobooks

One of my biggest Secret Rule was that I had to "Read" a book for it to count. I have been listening to podcast for more than a decade now. A medium I adored. Evangelized. It took me ten years to hold on to my "No Audiobooks" rule and a moment to break it.

### Books that spark joy

Like a studio exec trying to select the shows from hundreds of pilots, I started giving any book that took my fancy a go. I became ruthless in not reading books that didn't resonate with me. Tim Urban [talks about our life in weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).

Seeing our lives in this perspective was enlightening for me. Coming back to books, at 50 books a year, I can read 2500 books. 2500. If that means I read a lot of first (a few more if I want) chapters, and I feel like not reading it anymore. That is what I will do.

(As an aside, talking about first chapters—Italo Calvino's 
[If on a winter's night a traveler](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/374233.If_on_a_Winter_s_Night_a_Traveler)—is an experience. I don't want to tell you anything more. Go into it blind. I am glad it's part of my `library of death`)
